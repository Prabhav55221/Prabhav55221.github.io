# Random Stuff

Other things I do are (Links coming soon):

- Run! I could run a marathon before but I can hardly run 10 KMs now (Yes KMs and not miles).
- I read - A lot of fiction, some non-fiction and recently a lot of astrophysics/physics.
- I play the guitar (and try horribly to sing).
- I have an obsessive compulsion to keep a clean room and desk (albeit outside my room can be a dumpster).

My geek code is:

```
