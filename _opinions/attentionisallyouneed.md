excerpt: "Seven years later, the transformer architecture still dominates NLP. But are we missing something fundamental about how attention should work?"
---

It's been **seven years** since "Attention Is All You Need" dropped and fundamentally changed how we think about sequence modeling. The transformer architecture has become so ubiquitous that we rarely question its core assumptions anymore.

But here's my hot take: **we're still not using attention optimally**.

## The Good: Why Transformers Won

The original transformer was brilliant for several reasons:

- **Parallelization**: Unlike RNNs, attention allows parallel computation across sequence positions
- **Long-range dependencies**: Direct connections between any two positions
- **Interpretability**: Attention weights give us some insight into model behavior

These advantages were game-changing for NLP and explain why transformers scaled so effectively.

## The Problem: Attention Overload

However, I think we've become **too** reliant on attention as a solution to everything:

### 1. Quadratic Complexity Is Still A Problem
Despite various "efficient" attention mechanisms (Linear, Performer, etc.), we're still fundamentally limited by the O(n²) complexity for long sequences. Most "solutions" are approximations that trade accuracy for speed.

### 2. Attention Isn't Learning What We Think
Recent work shows that attention weights are often **not** good indicators of what the model is actually using for predictions. We've been over-interpreting attention visualizations.

### 3. Inductive Biases Matter
Transformers are remarkably flexible, but this flexibility comes at a cost. They need massive amounts of data to learn patterns that more structured architectures could capture with less data.

## What I Think We're Missing

Here's where I diverge from mainstream thinking:

> **Hot Take**: The future isn't about making attention more efficient—it's about knowing when NOT to use attention.

### Hybrid Architectures Are Underexplored
Why does everything have to be a transformer? Some tasks might benefit from:
- **Convolutions** for local patterns
- **RNNs** for sequential processing where order truly matters
- **Graph networks** for structured relationships

### Task-Specific Attention
Instead of using the same attention mechanism everywhere, we should design attention patterns that match the task:
- **Sparse attention** for document-level tasks
- **Hierarchical attention** for multi-scale problems
- **Structured attention** that respects linguistic hierarchies

## The Research Direction We Need

I'd love to see more work on:

1. **Attention Pattern Discovery**: Can we learn optimal attention patterns for specific tasks rather than using full attention?

2. **Modular Architectures**: Components that can be transformer-based when needed, but fall back to simpler mechanisms when appropriate.

3. **Better Inductive Biases**: How can we incorporate linguistic knowledge without sacrificing the flexibility that makes transform
