# hello!

<img src="https://Prabhav55221.github.io/profile.png" class="floatpic">

I'm **Prabhav Singh** *(pronounced **Prah-bav**)*.

<br>

I’m currently pursuing my **Master’s in Computer Science (Thesis)** with a specialization in [Human Language Technologies](https://www.clsp.jhu.edu/human-language-technology-masters/) at [Johns Hopkins University](https://engineering.jhu.edu), where I conduct research at the [Center for Language and Speech Processing (CLSP)](https://www.clsp.jhu.edu/). I’m fortunate to be advised by [Prof. Jason Eisner](https://www.cs.jhu.edu/~jason/) and [Prof. Jesus Villalba](https://engineering.jhu.edu/faculty/jesus-villalba/). Before this, I earned my **Bachelor’s in Electrical Engineering** from [Delhi University](https://www.du.ac.in), where I worked with [Prof. K.P.S. Rana](https://sites.google.com/site/kpsrana1/home) and [Prof. Vineet Kumar](http://nsut.ac.in/en/node/554) at the APC Lab, NSIT.

<br>

You can find more details in my [CV](https://Prabhav55221.github.io/file/prabhavsresume.pdf). Feel free to reach out at: `psingh at jhu dot edu`

## 🧠 my (ever-changing) research interests

- **Cheaper LLM Workflows**  
  Recently, I've been exploring **cost-efficient annotation and evaluation** using LLMs. This includes applying ideas from *Value of Information* ([ref](https://arxiv.org/abs/2110.13973), [ref](https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.5555/2051237.2051240)) and **gradient-based heuristics** ([ref](https://arxiv.org/abs/2002.08484), [ref](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.04333)) to accelerate decision-making in human-in-the-loop systems.

- **Multimodal Learning for Language and Speech**  
  I build models that integrate **speech, text, and vision** for tasks like **emotion recognition** ([example](https://Prabhav55221.github.io/file/EmoJudge_Interspeech_CameraReady.pdf)) and **speaker diarization** ([example](https://Prabhav55221.github.io/file/CYS_MYD_CameraReady.pdf)). I’m especially interested in learning from **heterogeneous modalities** with minimal supervision.

- **Structured Probabilistic Modeling**  
  My work also explores **multitask learning**, **Bayesian inference**, and **temporal modeling**, with a focus on interpretable representations of linguistic structure.
