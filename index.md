# hello!

<img src="https://Prabhav55221.github.io/profile.png" class="floatpic">

I'm **Prabhav Singh** *(pronounced **Prah-bav**)*.

<br>

I’m currently pursuing my **Master’s in Computer Science (Thesis)** with a specialization in [Human Language Technologies](https://www.clsp.jhu.edu/human-language-technology-masters/) at [Johns Hopkins University](https://engineering.jhu.edu), where I conduct research at the [Center for Language and Speech Processing (CLSP)](https://www.clsp.jhu.edu/). I’m fortunate to be advised by [Prof. Jason Eisner](https://www.cs.jhu.edu/~jason/) and [Prof. Jesus Villalba](https://engineering.jhu.edu/faculty/jesus-villalba/). Before this, I earned my **Bachelor’s in Electrical Engineering** from [Delhi University](https://www.du.ac.in), where I worked with [Prof. K.P.S. Rana](https://sites.google.com/site/kpsrana1/home) and [Prof. Vineet Kumar](http://nsut.ac.in/en/node/554) at the APC Lab, NSIT.

<br>

## my (ever-changing) research interests

<details open>
<summary><strong>Cheaper LLM + Human Workflows</strong>: Combining humans and LLMs in a pipeline that enables principled, cost-effective annotation and evaluation.</summary>

<br>

LLMs are increasingly employed as surrogate annotators and evaluators in NLP workflows. However, current practices often involve multiple heuristic decisions to design effective workflows. For example, choosing the appropriate subset to annotate, either by LLMs or humans, remains a costly decision.

Recently, I've been working on **AnnotationArena** — an end-to-end framework to streamline LLM-based evaluation and annotation. This includes:

- Using *Value of Information* ([ref](https://arxiv.org/abs/2110.13973), [ref](https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.5555/2051237.2051240)) for inference-time decision making.
- Leveraging **gradient-based heuristics** ([ref](https://arxiv.org/abs/2002.08484), [ref](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.04333)) for active learning.

I'm also exploring how to extend these approaches using **reinforcement learning** and **alignment techniques**, aiming for adaptive, continuous annotation pipelines with principled decisions.  
Additional interests include different labeling strategies like **ratings**, **ranking**, and **ordinal classification**.

<summary><strong>Multimodal Learning for Language and Speech</strong>: Fusing audio, text, and vision to solve tasks that are natural for humans — but hard for machines.</summary>

<br>

I build models that integrate **speech, text, and vision** for tasks like:

- **Emotion Recognition** ([example](https://Prabhav55221.github.io/file/EmoJudge_Interspeech_CameraReady.pdf))
- **Speaker Diarization** ([example](https://Prabhav55221.github.io/file/CYS_MYD_CameraReady.pdf))
- **Speaker Recognition** ([example](https://Prabhav55221.github.io/file/nistsre.pdf))

I aim to learn from **heterogeneous modalities** with **minimal supervision**, especially for socially grounded tasks.

I’ve developed some expertise in **emotion recognition**, which was my first research focus. Lately, I've shifted toward **speaker recognition** and **diarization**. I find diarization especially compelling — it’s a core speech task with many unsolved challenges, particularly in **cross-modal and real-world** settings.

<summary><strong>ML Learning Theory / Replicability</strong>: Understanding how adaptive decisions affect replicability in transfer learning.</summary>

<br>

Thanks to coursework at JHU, I’ve developed an interest in replicability theory — which differs from reproducibility. See: [Replicability vs. Reproducibility](https://arxiv.org/abs/2201.08430), [Replicability Bounds](https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.15284)

My recent work focuses on:

- Deriving **replicability bounds** for **transfer learning**.
- Studying how **adaptive data selection** affects replicability in transfer learning pipelines.

See our draft manuscript: [Sensitivity of Selectivity in Transfer Learning](https://Prabhav55221.github.io/file/SensitivityOfSelectivity.pdf) *(in progress)*
